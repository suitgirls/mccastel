    <p> Hi! I'm Maria Celeste Castellon Aleman, a senior from Nicaragua. My interest in technology sparked when I created a demo Nicaraguan sign language translator for my innovation fair. </p>
    <p> This project ignited my fascination with cybersecurity, especially how hackers can breach even the most secure systems. Apart from tech, I love playing volleyball and reading romance novels, particularly those with the enemies-to-lovers trope.</p>
